Sistema Integrado de Almacenamiento Inteligente (Intelligent Warehousing Integrated System)

SIAI is the software component developed to run a capstone project for an Intelligent Warehousing Integrated System prototype.
The warehousing system consists in a bunch of little AGV's (Automated Guided Vehicles) that transport the racks inside a warehouse.
This of course is inspired by several other systems such as those used by major retailer like Amazon and AliBaba.
